<h1>About me </h1>
<hr />
<p>
    I am a highly motivated and detail-oriented Computer Engineering student at the British University in Egypt (BUE),
    currently maintaining a GPA of 4.0 and ranked among the top students in my preparatory year. My academic journey has
    been enriched with practical projects that demonstrate my technical capabilities, such as building a trading
    platform using Object-Oriented Programming, designing a mini banking system, and developing a mathematical
    expression converter using C++ and Java. These experiences have strengthened my problem-solving skills, algorithmic
    thinking, and ability to work effectively in teams.<br />
    <br />

    In addition to my academic work, I am actively involved in student activities. I contributed to the BUE Student
    Union, where I developed strong communication, leadership, and time management skills. My technical skill set
    includes proficiency in C++, Java, pseudocode, Power BI, VS Code, and Microsoft Office applications, as well as
    content creation and video editing tools like Canva and CapCut.<br />

    <br />
    I am always eager to learn, take on new challenges, and contribute value wherever I go. I enjoy working on
    innovative ideas, exploring different cultures, and engaging in hobbies like reading, swimming, photography, and
    creative design. <br />
